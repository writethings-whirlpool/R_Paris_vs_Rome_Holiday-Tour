# R_Paris_vs_Rome_Holiday-Tour
A short R Project featuring comparison and average figures for 5 day and 4 nights Holiday Tour in Paris and/or Rome;
the goal of this R document is to serve as a budgeting visual guide for a five-day tour in Paris, France and in Rome, Italy. 
The figures indicated in this table are based on the costs indicated in the 2023 pages directly and officially related to the 
respective cities' transportation, travel, and popular tourist attractions. Due to various economic factors (inflation, tourist 
popularity, etc.) that may change the accuracy of the data with time, fellow travelers are encouraged to always check and compare 
current costs for an efficient travel-budgeting.

I hope this project also helps fellow R language newbies and travelers alike :)
